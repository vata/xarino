Xara LX is primarily a vector graphics (drawing and illustration) program but is 
one of the new generation of cross-over products that handles photos and 
drawings with equal ease. See xaralx.org for details. Xara LX is currently 
incomplete as it is an ongoing port to Linux of the finished product Xara Xtreme 
(see www.xara.com/xtreme).

For the last 2 years or so it has been somewhat dead so i am now in the process of resurecting it :-)
