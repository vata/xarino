*** C++ ***

* follow Xara C++ style conventions for indenting and commenting
* add proper comments
* the error handling is non-existent (exceptions?)
* generate XAR tags for objects/groups labels (id and xml:id properties)
* review the tree of #include's and remove useless ones

*** SVG ***

* fill-rule fill property
* stroke-linecap, stroke-linejoin, stroke-miterlimit, stroke-dasharray, stroke-dashoffset
* solidColor in <defs>
* gradient radial fill
* handle <defs> in the correct way: each one should have its own hashtable and
  the filter should handle objects defined there and referenced later with <use /> (2)
* parse <style type="text/css"> section (1)
* bitmaps
* texts

*** Known Bugs ***

* linear and radial fills have wrong coordinates defined
* linear and radial fills using ObjectBoundingBox are not drawn

* tests/rects_css.svg fails because of (1)
* tests/paths4.svg fails because of (2)
