Version 0.4 (WIP)

* Implemented opacity in groups and shapes.
* Added arcs support to paths.

Version 0.3

* Most of the code have been rewritten or reviewed and the SVGImporter
  has been cleaned up (all the XAR generation functions have been moved
  to the new specialized XARGenerator class in xargenerator.cpp).
* Implemented rounded rectangles.
* Fully implemented paths (support for remaining 'S', 's', 'Q', 'q', 'T', 't'
  SVG <path d="" /> parameters added).
* Implemented transformations.
* Added support for xml:id="" and id="" properties (still not enabled).
* Rewritten <svg viewBox="" /> attribute parsing using transformations.
* Rewritten support for measures ("cm", "pt", ecc.) using proper transformations.
* Partially implemented parsing of <defs /> children to handle #url() and xlinks
  in styles attributes.
* Implemented partial support for linear fills.
* Cleaned up debug messages.  Now a --svgdebug flag to "configure" is available
  to enable debug code; the messages class is selected using the "-T tracelevel"
  option to "svgfilter" (more information in README).
* Fixed error messages to follow properly Xara's filter convention (e.g.
  "ERROR: " and "WARNING: " prefixes).

Version 0.2

* We are now able to open at least simple SVG files.
