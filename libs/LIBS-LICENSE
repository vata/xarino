                    Copyright (C) 1993-2006 Xara Group Ltd.
       Copyright on certain contributions may be held in joint with their
              respective authors. See AUTHORS file for details.


TEMPORARY LICENSE FOR CDRAW
---------------------------

This license applies ONLY to the "CDraw" libraries ("Libraries")
distributed in the "libs" directory. Xara intends to release these
under the same license as the remainder of the Xara LX program,
at which time this header will be changed to indicate that. However,
for the time being, the Libraries are distributed in binary
form only, and you may use them only under the terms of this license.

In layman's terms, the intent of this license is to say that if you
distribute the libraries, you must either do it with a XaraLX executable,
or with the source itself (if you don't want to do this, please just
refer people to our web site where they can download the libraries);
and you are only allowed to use the libraries with the GPL version
of XaraLX. The legal terms are set out below.


LICENSE TO USE AND DISTRIBUTE SOFTWARE
--------------------------------------

Xara Group hereby grants you a royalty free license to use and distribute
the Libraries in object code form provided that you comply with the
following conditions:

1. You may not distribute any Library or any work derived therefrom
   unless EITHER
   a) the Library is contained within an executable program or package
      of executable programs that also contains an object code version
      of a Xara LX Derivative; OR
   b) the Libraries are contained in a larger work also comprising the
      complete source code of a Xara LX Derivative.

2. You may not link (staticly or dynamicly) the Libraries to any work
   other than a Xara LX Derivative, nor use the Libraries if linked to
   any other such work.

3. "Xara LX Derivative" means the program distributed by Xara Group Ltd
   under the name "Xara LX", or any work derived from it and lawfully
   distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2.

4. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
   FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
   OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
   PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
   OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
   TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
   PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
   REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

5. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
   REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
   OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
   TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
   YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
   PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
