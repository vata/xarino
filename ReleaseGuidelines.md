# Introduction #

Every stage of a programs progress needs a distinctive release name to build its brand and help make it recognisable within the community. There also needs to be sufficient innovation in each release to keep users interested and provide a reason to upgrade whilst sufficient attention to stability needs to be given as to not damage the projects reputation and destroy users work so the timing of a release schedule is key to the success of a project.

This are the guidelines which should be applied to choosing the name for a release and when it should happen:
  * Since several years have gone past since a XaraLX release we will just start at zero for Xarino (XaraLX got up to 0.7 and Xtream is at 4.0).
  * Release names are chosen as emotive statements summing up what the release means to the project (e.g. 0.1 is "it actually works").
  * Each name should sound like a statement of sufficient emphasis to deserve and exclamation mark.
  * Subreleases (0.11 etc) should be named either as topical humorous names or as major changes within them (e.g. when we introduce the new icon scheme the subrelease could be "decent icons at last", or something more creative).
  * The person managing each subrelease gets to name it whereas each major (0.1 etc) releases name will be discussed before finalization (although provisional names may be in use before then).
  * Integer releases are a whole different matter. 1.0 is a long way off and we will decide the name when we get nearer
  * Releases (0.1 etc) should have been tested substantially before release to ensure stability.
  * Subreleases will contain features destined for the next release and should be considered unstable. They should work without any immediately obvious showstoppers but this may not always be the case.
  * Before every major release after 0.3 we will have one beta release first for testing which should contain all of the features for the release and and after that only bug fixes may be included after that. Any other changes must go in a trunk for inclusion in a later release.
  * In terms of the SVN repo we should tag for every subrelease. We should aim to work on commit to trunk as soon as a revisions are in a usable state but try and ensure that nothing we commit to trunk stops it from building.
