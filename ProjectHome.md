Xarino is primarily a vector graphics (drawing and illustration) program but is
one of the new generation of cross-over products that handles photos and
drawings with equal ease. See xaralx.org for details. Xarino is currently
incomplete as it is an ongoing port to Linux of the finished product Xara Xtreme
(see www.xara.com/xtreme).

For the last 2 years or so it has been somewhat dead (the previous project was called XaraLX) so I am now in the process of resurrecting it :-)
